# l2l language support in Atom

This is cobbled together from [language-lisp](https://atom.io/packages/language-lisp) and [language-luajit](https://atom.io/packages/language-luajit) to provide basic syntax highlighting support for the [l2l language](https://github.com/meric/l2l), which has a grammar that is a superset of Lisp and Lua.
